# PS-Libs-Dashboard
The demo Ionic Framework application for my Pluralsight course on the Ionic CLI.

## What is it?
Do you remember MadLibs from the 70s (it may still be around)? 
This is a lame attempt at building something
similar, purely as a demonstration of using the Ionic
CLI to put together a simple app. The steps themselves
are part of the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) Course on using the 
Ionic CLI, and can be found there. This is not a complete app, but should be
considered a very basic starting point.

## Quick Start
- Install Ionic Framework  `npm i -g ionic`.
- Clone this repository
- `npm install`
- `ionic serve`
